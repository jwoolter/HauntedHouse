# Haunted House
run `HauntedHouse.py` to play the game:

current features:
- movement: move throughout the haunted house's many rooms
- objects: scour the room for objects (the key allows you to enter locked rooms and the torch dark ones)
- bag: use, drop and view objects you have collected (use matches to light the torch, but be careful the flame diminishes)

bugs:
do not enter anything apart from integars when prompted what you would like to do.
